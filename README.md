# Comparative study of Bitcoin price prediction using WaveNets, Recurrent Neural Networks and other Machine Learning Methods

# Abstract:
Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations that do effectively forecast. However, with the recent advancement in computational capacity of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. This article compares different methodologies like ARIMA, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and WaveNets for estimating the price of bitcoin data.

# Comparação de Modelos

Here we present the comparison of the ARIMA, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Wavenet models. To perform the comparison, we used a cross-validation of 30. In addition, to be fair, we optimized the hyper-parameters following the same methodology.
